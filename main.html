	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to complete as a function of its input size. In other words, it quantifies how the algorithm's performance scales with larger datasets. A key goal in algorithm design is to achieve efficient time complexity, ensuring that as the input grows, the algorithm remains fast and doesn't become a bottleneck. Engineers and developers strive to create algorithms with optimal time complexity to ensure their software or systems can handle increasing data loads while maintaining responsive and smooth performance. This focus on efficient time complexity is essential in various domains, ranging from web applications and databases to scientific simulations and artificial intelligence algorithms.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>, an essential counterpart to its temporal counterpart, Time Complexity. Space Complexity quantifies the amount of memory an algorithm requires as its input size scales. Represented using the Big O notation, such as O(n) where 'n' symbolizes the input size,</p>
